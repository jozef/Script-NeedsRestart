    indication when to terminate the loop to initiate auto restarted.

  restart
    re-exec current script

  restart_if_needed
    will re-exec current script if it or any dependent files changed.

  set_logger
    setting optional logger, if set, ` check_mtimes() ' and ` restart() '
    will will log their events.

        Script::NeedsRestart->set_logger($log);
